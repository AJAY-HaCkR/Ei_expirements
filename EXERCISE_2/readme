Satellite Command System – Rules

>Always monitor your satellite’s battery; it drains with each action.
>Activate solar panels to recharge when battery is low.
>Solar panels will auto-deactivate when the battery is full to prevent overcharging.
>Collect data only when the satellite has enough battery.
>Rotate the satellite to North, South, East, or West to access different data sources.
>Avoid leaving solar panels active unnecessarily to save battery.
>Use the status command to check current orientation, panel status, data collected, and battery level.
>Follow the correct command format; invalid commands will not be executed.
>Continuously monitor battery and panel status during operation.
>Exit the program safely using the exit command.

fun fact:
>you may get signals from countries and even from planets....

The system can:

Rotate the satellite in four directions (North, South, East, West)
Activate or deactivate solar panels
Collect data when panels are active
Monitor battery level and auto-deactivate panels to prevent overcharging
Show the current status of the satellite
The project uses object-oriented programming concepts and SOLID principles.

Classes Used

Satellite – Holds the satellite’s state (orientation, solar panels, data collected, battery).

Battery – Tracks battery level and consumption.

SolarPanel – Controls the activation or deactivation of solar panels.

DataCollector – Simulates data collection from different sources (like countries or moons).

Command Interface – Defines a common interface for all commands.

RotateCommand, ActivatePanelsCommand, DeactivatePanelsCommand, CollectDataCommand, StatusCommand – Implement the command actions.

InputHandler – Parses user inputs and returns the corresponding command.

SimpleLogger – Logs events to the console.

InvalidCommandException – Handles invalid commands.

How the Program Works

The program initializes the satellite with:
Orientation = North
Solar Panels = Inactive
Data Collected = 0
Battery = 100%
The program continuously accepts commands from the user.

Commands include:

rotate <North|South|East|West>
activatePanels
deactivatePanels
collectData
status
exit


The satellite automatically handles battery usage and panel overcharge protection.

Data is collected only when battery is sufficient.

How to Run the Program

Put all Java files in one folder.

Open a terminal in that folder.

Compile all Java files:

javac *.java


Run the program:

java App.java


Enter commands in the terminal to control the satellite
